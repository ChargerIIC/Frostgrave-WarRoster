# Frostgrave-WarRoster
Angular 2 application that tracks a Frostgrave player's mage and related assets. 

This has been created as both a learning exercise and an actual utility to help me track my character progress. It's currently a purely client side application so there is no saving and the data only contains items from the first book.
