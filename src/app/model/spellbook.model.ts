The spellcaster rapidly speeds up the passing of time in a small area of the structure, causing it to collapse. This can effectively create a doorway-sized hole through any wall, which should be indicated on the table somehow. The spell can also be used to collapse a section of floor beneath a figure standing on a level above the ground. In this case, the figure about to be affected must pass a Will roll versus the casting roll, or fall to the next level down and taking damage appropriately.";
